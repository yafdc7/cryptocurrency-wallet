‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

Unlike Python-based brute force tools, **WalletGen** is written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, delivering up to **10x faster** performance. Whether you‚Äôre exploring lost wallets, verifying private key space, or recovering your own wallet, WalletGen gives you the power to do it efficiently and securely.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** can help.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat.
*   Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat.
*   Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search stops.
*   The details are shown.
*   The data is saved.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the found wallet into a crypto wallet.
2.  You‚Äôll be able to transfer the funds.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen recovers Bitcoin wallets.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is missing words, use *.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

![recovery](/resources/visual.webp)

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol.
*   Searching for missing words may take time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/resources/scheme.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0).
